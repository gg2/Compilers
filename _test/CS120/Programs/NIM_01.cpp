/*
 * The game of NIM â€”
 * a simple program introducing some 
 * fundamental programming concepts.
 * 
 * Modified 2014/09/19 by Gabe Gibler
 * CS120-03
 * Assignment #3
 *
 * 1) Modified to accept a user name and utilize that throughout the game; along with some other personalization touches.
 * 2) Asks to display the rules, and does so if desired.
 * 3) Prints the number of objects removed by each player.
 * 4) Implemented srand() to seed random selection of computer's move.
 * 5) Allowed specification of # of chits.
 * 6) Instituted the possibility of naming the playing pieces (something other than chits).
 * 7) Set player names to an array (switching array per current_player).
 *
