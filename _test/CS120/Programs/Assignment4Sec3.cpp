/*
 * The game of NIM â€”
 * a simple program introducing some 
 * fundamental programming concepts.
 * 
 * Modified 2014/09/24 by Gabe Gibler
 * CS120-03
 * Assignment #4
 * 
 * 1) Added commentary.
 * 2) Added the "graphical" output of playing pieces.
 * 3) Added a replay option, and scorekeeping
