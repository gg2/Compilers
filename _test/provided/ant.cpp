//------------------- ant Methods ----------------------------

/* Note on coordinate system:
 * This implementation assumes a set of "normal" Euclidean axes. 
 * In particular, moving "north" moves the ant "up" the screen, and
 * increases its y-coordinate by 1, while moving "south" does the
 * opposite.  Similarly, moving "east" moves the ant to the right,
 * and increases its x-coordinate by 1.  Therefore, when printing,
 * the row and column indices would look like this:
 * 
 *        +Y
 * (MAX_Y-1) |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 * (MAX_Y-2) |   |   |   |   |   |   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *     ...   |///|///|///|///|///|   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *     ...   |///|///|///|///|///|   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *         2 |0,2|1,2|2,2|///|///|   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *         1 |0,1|1,1|2,1|///|///|   |
 *           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---
 *         0 |0,0|1,0|2,0|///|///|   |
 *        ---+---+---+---+---+---+---+--- 
 *      -x   | 0   1   2  ... ...  *   **  +x
 *        -y
 * 
 *    * = MAX_X-2
 *   ** = MAX_X-1
 * 
 * In order to achieve this using normal streaming output commands
 * (cout << .... << endl; etc.) you will need to count _down_ the y/row
 * values.  Otherwise, when moving in the y direction, your ant will
 * appear to move "backwards".
 * 
 */

/* Note on implementation:
 * All movement methods use a simple switch statement off of the current
 * direction.  While not necessarily the most concise or general solution,
 * it has the advantage of being fairly easy to understand and shows how
 * similar the logic for each method is, so it is the method I chose.

 * energy is decremented, the direction is updated to the new, correct
 * facing, and a value of true is returned to indicate success.
