Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator
_______________________________________

Program Design
--------------

* All numbers as <double>;
* No specification on how errors are to be handled;

Loop continuously until "quit" command entered;
Always display top of stack in command prompt;
Read strings from input;
If is number, push to stack;
If is operator, pop appropriate # of items from stack (2 by default, apparently; sometimes 1), perform operation, push result to stack;

Calculator
	Stack object
	
	top(): to print out top of stack
	store(): to save input to the stack for calculations
	
	add
	subtract
	multiply
	divide
	sq
	sqrt
	dup
	swap
	ps (aka print stack)
	quit

Stack
	LinkedList object

	push(): add an item to the stack
	pop(): retrieve and delete top item from the stack
	getTop(): return value of last item added to stack
	print(): return listing of values of each item in stack
	count(): returns number items on the stack; more useful for error-checking than a simple "is it empty?"

Linked List 
	head: pointer to node object
	count: number of nodes in list
	Node objects
	
	getCount(): returns count
	insert(): add new node to list
	remove(): delete node from list
	getLast(): return data from most recently added node
	list(): return listing of values of each item in list

Node
	data: data stored in this node
	next: next node in the list; NULL if is the last
