No real problems encountered this time, except that C++ is retarded because it treats const as though it makes a new type rather than simply being an access modifier. Couldn't send std::string.c_str() to the hash table functions because it output a "const char*" rather than "char*" ... really!!? Anyway, not a big deal (thank you, Google).
