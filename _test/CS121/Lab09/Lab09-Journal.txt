13:50-14:00 > Still working on gathering pieces to be able to test part 2.
14:50-16:20 > Figuring out a segmentation fault while testing the stack, and Stack.push() specifically. Apparently I all of a sudden can't assign a NULL head to a Node pointer. Worked fucking fine in the linked list I created before for the RPN calculator. I see that the sample code on the website especially handles the case of a NULL head for adding to a linked list. Perhaps a difference between how classes and structs work?
Fucking pain in the ass sudden obscure differences!!!
17:50-21:20 > Creating slightly more generic function for testing stack.push() and improving output. Continuing on with other 2 functions. Revising the zip function, now that the world has suddenly rearranged and apparently it's a stack class I can use, and not just linked lists (even though it is still linked lists that are being "zipped"). Spending for fucking ever trying to make the zip function return a fucking value coherently and without creating side effects. Troubleshooting glibc errors, which apparently have to do with the program trying to automatically delete the same value twice. So I can't get the fucking function to work with a stack by reference or pointer. I can't get it to pass a stack object back out of the fucking function. I have to specifically create a pointer to a stack object outside the function and within, and create a new stack within the function and make sure to delete that pointer within the function after passing the reference out of the function. Fucking retarded. Why is such a simple thing as working with an object in a function so fucking difficult?
21:50-23:00 > Attempting 3rd function now. Functionizing more of the testing methods. 3rd function and testing functions works great! Fucking amazing!!! But now TestZip fucking returned with Glibc or segmentation faults again!!! Did I even change anything in it?!! I fixed an undefined int variable issue (which hadn't shown up before for some reason), and switched the 1st loop from for to while (which removed the newly defined int anyway). I didn't fundamentally change how the fucking function is passing stacks in and out, and suddenly it doesn't fucking work anymore? What the fuck!!! 
23:00-00:05 > The function even works properly for a few times before throwing a fit. Trying combo of pointers and such that had no problems in the TestDeleteNegs fuction... Runs all amok while pushing to the 2nd stack while running the TestZip for the 3rd time. I don't know what the fuck it's doing. Everything looks fine to me up until the time it crashes. And the whole fucking thing ran fine before something I did.
